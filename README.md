There are many benefits to using functions. Functions can reduce the complexity of the main program. After repeated use of functions, the main program only has 21 lines. In addition, functions are convenient for debugging, because all functions are divided into small pieces by functions, so you only need to check the related functions near the error to confirm the problem. The same function can also be reused in different places, making the entire program modular, making the program easier to manage and modify, and reducing the occurrence of errors.
